# p42-clips-640-ug: <br> Technical manual translation proposal: CLIPS 6.4 User's Guide (2021 revised version)

- [Versión castellana, aquí...](README.md)

> The historical CLIPS 6.31 User Guide, published in 2014, is an essential piece of documentation to get started in non-imperative programming guided by events and actions. It has been reviewed by Dr. Joseph C. Giarratano, and Edited by Gary Riley, last year 2021. The new version of the `CLIPS 6.4 User's Guide` contains the latest advances of version 6.40 of CLIPS and is available at SourceForge[^1].

- Estimated completion date of the translation: September 2022[^translator].
- The navigable version is found in both languages at: [dpsFramework.org/guides/clips-640](https://dpsframework.org/guides/clips-640/clips-640-user-guide-chapter-00_en.html )



## Acknowledgments
To the authors of the Guide: Dr. JC Giarratano and the tireless Gary Riley. And also, to this guide itself. Because the `CLIPS User Guide` is the tip of a huge iceberg. That hides the best of CLIPS and COOL, full of good humor and patience with those of us who come to this Language in search of solutions to complex problems. They, without scaring anyone, managed years ago with this simple work to gradually introduce the field of heuristic knowledge and programming driven by facts; and, just for the facts.




## Proposal description: P42-CLIPS-640-UG
  

## Section 1: Identification
- Proposal date: April, 2022.
- Location of results: GitHub repo and website dpsFramework.org

## Section 2: Translation
